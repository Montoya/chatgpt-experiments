> Write code for a simple webpage with a list of links

Here is an example of a simple webpage with a list of links:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Links</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Links</h1>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://google.com">Google</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a></li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

This webpage consists of a simple HTML document with a title element, a h1 element, and an unordered list containing a few a elements. Each a element represents a link, and it has an href attribute that specifies the URL of the linked page. When the user clicks on a link, their web browser will navigate to the specified URL.

To create a similar webpage, you will need to create an HTML document and include the desired content in the body element. You can use the ul and li elements to create an unordered list, and you can use the a element to create links. Be sure to include an href attribute on each a element to specify the URL of the linked page.
