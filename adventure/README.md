> Show me the code for a simple text adventure played in a browser

Here is an example of a simple text adventure that can be played in a web browser:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>

  <head>
    <title>Text Adventure</title>

    <style>
      /* Some basic styling for the page */

      body {

        max-width: 600px;
        margin: auto;
        padding: 20px;
        text-align: center;
      }

      h1 {
        text-align: center;

          <p>After a few minutes, you come to a clearing. In the center of the clearing, you see a small cottage. There is smoke coming from the chimney and the door is slightly ajar.</p>

        enterButton.addEventListener('click', e => {

Here is an updated version of the text adventure code that is more generic and can be used to create different adventures:

Here is the JavaScript snippet from the previous example:

```JavaScript

const state = {
  // The starting location of the player
  location: 'forest',

  // The locations in the game and their descriptions
  locations: {

// Get a reference to the body of the document
const body = document.querySelector('body');

> Update the previous example to use emoji for the locations

Here is an updated version of the text adventure code that uses emoji for the locations:

> Update the previous example to show an appropriate message when the user clicks a button that does not have a location to go to

Here is an updated version of the text adventure code that shows an appropriate message when the user clicks a button that does not have a location to go to:

  // Create a button for each direction in the current location
  for (const direction in location.directions) {
    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.id = direction;

    buttons.appendChild(button);
  }

  // Clear the body of the document and add the description and buttons
  body.innerHTML = '';

  body.appendChild(buttons);

  // Add event listeners to the buttons to handle clicks

      }

      // Update the page with the new game state
      update();
    });
  }
}
```

_For some reason this does not work when going to a location that does not exist, so:_

> in the previous example, there is an error when the description is not found. update it to fix the error

Here is an updated version of the text adventure code that fixes the error when the description is not found:

```

> in the previous example there is still an error. you are allowing the user to reach a location that does not exist. you should be showing a message and keeping the location the same. please fix this and just show me the update function in the new example.

Here is the updated `update` function from the previous example that shows a message and keeps the location the same when the user tries to go to a location that does not exist:

```JavaScript
// Helper function to update the page with the current state of the game
function update() {
  // Get the current location and its description
  const location = state.locations[state.location];

```

> Update the "you are lost" message from the previous example to say "You have exited the bounds of this world. You can start over if you want." and show a single button that the user can click to start the game over from the first location, and just show me the update function

Here is the updated `update` function from the previous example that shows a message and a button when the user tries to go to a location that does not exist, allowing them to start the game over from the first location:

```JavaScript
// Helper function to update the page with the current state of the game
function update() {
  // Get the current location and its description
  const location = state.locations[state.location];
  const description = location ? location.description : 'You have exited the bounds of this world. You can start over if you want.';

          state.location = nextLocation;
        } else {
          // Show a message and keep
```

> show me the update function starting from line 30 onwards

Here is the updated `update` function from the previous example starting from line 30 onwards, which shows a message and a button when the user tries to go to a location that does not exist, allowing them to start the game over from the first location:

```JavaScript
...

// Clear the body of the document and add the description and buttons
body.innerHTML = '';
body.appendChild(p);
body.appendChild(buttons);

// Add event listeners to the buttons to handle clicks
if (location) {
  for (const direction in location.directions) {
    const button = document.getElementById(direction);
    button.addEventListener('click', e => {
      // Update the game state based on the clicked button
      const nextLocation = location.directions[direction];
      if (nextLocation) {
        state.location = nextLocation;
      } else {
        // Show a message and keep the location the same if the clicked button does not have a location to go to
        p.innerText = 'You cannot go that way.';
        state.location = location;
      }

      // Update the page with the new game state
      update();
    });
  }
} else {
  // Create a button to start the game over from the first location
  const startOverButton = document.createElement('button');
  startOverButton.id = 'startOver';
  startOverButton.innerText = 'Start Over';
  buttons.appendChild(startOverButton);
  startOverButton.addEventListener('click', e => {
    // Update the game state to start the game over
    state.location = 'forest';

    // Update the page with the new game state
    update();
  });
}
```

> modify the previous example to show just one button for start over instead of two and show me just the update function

Here is the updated `update` function from the previous example that shows a message and a single button when the user tries to go to a location that does not exist, allowing them to start the game over from the first location:

```JavaScript
// Helper function to update the page with the current state of the game
function update() {
  // Get the current location and its description
  const location = state.locations[state.location];
  const description = location ? location.description : 'You have exited the bounds of this world. You can start over if you want.';

  // Create HTML elements for the description and the buttons
  const p = document.createElement('p');
  p.innerText = description;
  const buttons = document.createElement('div');

  // Create a button for each direction in the current location
  if (location) {
    for (const direction in location.directions) {
      const button = document.createElement('button');
      button.id = direction;

      update();
    });
  }

  // Clear the body of the document and add the description and buttons
  body.innerHTML = '';

          state.location = nextLocation;
        } else {
          // Show a message and keep the location the same if the clicked button does not have a location to go to
          p.innerText = 'You cannot go that way.';
          state.location = location;
        }

        // Update the page with the new game state
        update();
      });
    }

}
```

> modify the previous example so that the buttons are variable width so that the text inside the button always fits, and show me the CSS to do this

Here is the CSS to make the buttons in the previous example variable width so that the text inside the button always fits:

```CSS
button {
  display: inline-block;
  width: auto;
}
```
